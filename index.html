        <h2><a name="howtoplay"></a>How To Play</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Players decide who is Player 1 or Player 2 offline. Player 2 launches the app and assigns himself Player to in the Preferences tab.</li>
          <li>Player 1 launches the game and taps New Game</li>
          <li>Both players are shown green tiles for only 5 seconds</li>
          <li>After 5 seconds, the game has started. Players will take turns attempting to tap on the green tiles.</li>
          <li>After 10 turns, the player with the most matching green tiles wins!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notable Design Choices</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>History of matches are stored in firebase and loaded into the tables.</li>
          <li>Singletons are not used as notifications as notifications are being passed in with data</li>
          <li>The history is refering it's own firebase reference, however after looking at the source code and documentation the firebase reference is cached so there is no additional overhead. Details:

            <code>
                /*<br/>
                this is referencing a cached copy - indicating in the docs<br/>
                /**<br/>
                * Creates, caches, and returns a `FIRFirestore` using the default `FIRApp`. Each subsequent<br/>
                * invocation returns the same `FIRFirestore` object.<br/>
                *<br/>
                * @return The `FIRFirestore` instance.<br/>
                */<br/>
                + (instancetype)firestore NS_SWIFT_NAME(firestore());<br/>
                <br />              
                source code is @ https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/tree/master/Firestore/Source/API<br />              
               */<br />              
               private let _db: Firestore = {<br />              
                   let db: Firestore = Firestore.firestore()<br />              
                   return db        <br />              
               }()              <br />              
            </code>            
          </li>
          
        </ul>



        <h2>Limitations</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Player 1 is the main user and must start a game. Player 2 listens for an incoming game. This was part of the requirement.</li>
          <li>The entire game is stored on the network and local storage is not really used as it always retrieves data from Firebase.</li>                    
        </ul>

        <h2>Future Development</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Automatic Matchmaking - Ability to play a game without assigning player 1 or 2</li>
          <li>Unlimited number of devices playing games. The firebase data is currently set up for this but logic needs to be developed to join open matches.</li>
          <li>Show matching green tiles after the game is over.</li>
        </ul>
